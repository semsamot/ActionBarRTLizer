ActionBar RTLizer (ActionBar RTL Arranger)
===

A library that can RTLize android `ActionBar`!

It is not a custom `ActionBar` or anything else!
Its only a piece of code that can re-arrange the android `ActionBar` in RTL direction.

Announcement
---
ActionBarRTLizer v2 has arrived!  
Fully compatible with API Level 7+ and all issues has been solved!  
Based on a new Amazaing ~~Library~~ Class -> Rtlize Everything!  

Usage (only 3 simple steps)
---
**1)** Add this line to `build.gradle` file inside your app project folder:
```groovy
dependencies {
    compile 'info.semsamot:actionbar-rtlizer:2.+@aar'
}
```

**2)** Define a private variable of `ActionBarRtlizer` class in your activity class.

```java
private ActionBarRtlizer rtlizer;
```

**3)** In `onCreateOptionsMenu` method of your activity, before `return` statement, add these lines:

```java
rtlizer = new ActionBarRtlizer(this);
ViewGroup actionBarView = rtlizer.getActionBarView();
ViewGroup homeView = (ViewGroup)rtlizer.getHomeView();

rtlizer.flipActionBarUpIconIfAvailable(homeView);
RtlizeEverything.rtlize(actionBarView);
RtlizeEverything.rtlize(homeView);
```

If you are using `Toolbar` widget instead of `ActionBar` then you may change the first line to:
```java
rtlizer = new ActionBarRtlizer(this, "toolbar"); // "toolbar" or any other id for your Toolbar widget.
```

Then compile your app and enjoy of this awesome RTLization!

Alternative features
---
You can retrieve `ActionBarView`, `ActionMenuView` and `HomeView` after RTLization has been completed.
Fortunately you can listen for RTLization completed event.

An example of using these features is that you can animate ActionBar menu items after RTLization. it's so simple! (see the below sample)

 ** doesn't work on v2+ yet. **
```java
rtlizer.setOnRtlizeFinishedListener(new ActionBarRtlizer.OnRtlizeFinishedListener() {
    @Override
    public void onRtlizeFinished()
    {
        Animation rotateAnim = AnimationUtils.loadAnimation(getBaseContext(), R.anim.rotate);
        View actionMenuItem = rtlizer.getActionMenuView().findViewById(
                R.id.action_item);
        actionMenuItem.setAnimation(rotateAnim);
    }
});
```

Provided methods for retrieving ActionBar view and its children:

```java
// All return value types are of ViewGroup class.
getActionBarView()
getHomeViewContainer() // returns null on lower API versions than 17
getHomeView()
getActionMenuView()
```
